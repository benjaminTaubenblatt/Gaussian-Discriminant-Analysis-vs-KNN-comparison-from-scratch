# Gaussian-Discriminant-Analysis-vs-KNN-comparison-from-scratch
An implementation of Gaussian Discriminant Analysis and k-Nearest Neighbors algorithms from scratch in Python3. Data was first generated from a gaussian distribution and then from a mixture of 3 gaussians. Done as part of an Assignment for COMP 551: Applied Machine Learning at McGill University.
